// src/kernels/cuda/dsa_topk.cuh - the DSA indexer's choice of the top pools in O(n_vis) (one block, 1024 threads).
//
// The order it writes is the one the O(n_vis^2) rank loop wrote (score descending, ties by the lower pool index), so
// the selected cells - and every result built on them - are unchanged; only the cost stops growing with the square of
// the context (at 30k tokens the old loop was ~56M comparisons per DSA layer per token, in one block).
//   1. a radix select over the scores' order-preserving uint32 keys (three passes of 12, 12 and 8 bits, the cut-off
//      bin found by a block scan) finds the cut-off key - the top-th largest - and how many keys equal to it are taken;
//   2. the winners above the cut are collected in any order with coalesced reads; the ones equal to it too when all of
//      them are taken, else the first `need` in pool order (the lower indices, as the rank loop chose);
//   3. each winner's rank is the count of the winners larger than it (the values are distinct).
// One block at 2k keys: 18 -> 12 us, at 31k: 35 -> 25 (RTX 5090, v1.3.3; the earlier version: four 8-bit passes, a
// serial bin walk, a bitonic sort). The warp scans assume 32 lanes: the HIP backend runs wave32 only (device.cu), and
// on a Radeon 8060S (gfx1151) the same code takes 34 -> 14 us at 2k keys, 61 -> 27 at 31k, with the same cells.
